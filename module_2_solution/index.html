                <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. 
                    Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them 
                    in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens 
                    have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures 
                    around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted 
                    to regional tastes

                <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly 
                    skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric 
                    times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.

                <p>Sushi is made of small pieces of raw fish that are wrapped in 
                    rice and seaweed. The seaweed, called nori, is collected with 
                    submerged bamboo nets. While some sushi is mass-produced using 
                    robots, the best sushi is made by hand.
